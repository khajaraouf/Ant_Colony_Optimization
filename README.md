# Ant Colony Optimization

Ants are social insects. They live in colonies. The behavior of the ants is controlled by the goal of searching for food. While searching, ants roaming around their colonies. An ant repeatedly hops from one place to another to find the food. While moving, it deposits an organic compound called pheromone on the ground. Ants communicate with each other via pheromone trails. When an ant finds some amount of food it carries as much as it can carry. When returning it deposits pheromone on the paths based on the quantity and quality of the food. Ant can smell pheromone. So, other ants can smell that and follow that path. The higher the pheromone level has a higher probability of choosing that path and the more ants follow the path, the amount of pheromone will also increase on that path.
